Parce que get_next_line, c'est pas marrant.
Named after my favourite (not really) classmate, greg aka le big G.

GetNextLine: Because even your computer deserves a break from reading too much at once.

GetNextLine grabs one line at a time from a file, so your program doesn’t get overwhelmed trying to read everything at once. It’s like taking small bites instead of devouring the whole cookie in one go!
